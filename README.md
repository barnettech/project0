# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

The project aims to of course satisfy all project requirements, and highlights my new developing interest in rocket science!
There are four html pages as was asked for, the majority of the work is on the home page.  The other 3 pages
have just the navigation area as per the requirements, so you can get to and from each page from any other page.

The project can be viewed on github pages at https://barnettech.github.io/project0/
